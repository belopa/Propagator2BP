This repository is meant to solve Lambert's problem. With this initial trajectory, the aim is to do a step wise propagation to achieve a resulting orbit, adding E and resolve Lambert's problem for new values of E.

This is the propagation side of the code which then feeds into the perturbation analysis. The goal is to get the propagation to work so that at each discretised position, a perturbation can be applied
